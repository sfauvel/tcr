= TCR


TCR = Test, commit or revert.

The idea came from Kent Beck (link:https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864[test && commit || revert]) to reducing size of change. 

When you run tests, if they pass, changes are commited. 
If they failed, your changes are reverted.

You can resume it with command: `test && commit || revert`

== Quick start

Initialize a git repository: +
`git init && git add . && git commit -m "init"`

Create a script `run_test.sh` that execute test and exit with 0 it they passed and 1 if they failed.

Execute this command to run test and commit or revert: +
`bash run_test.sh && git commit -am working || git checkout HEAD -- .`

You can view commit done with: +
`git log --oneline` +
or +
`git log --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%Creset %s (%Cblue%cd%Creset)' --date=format:'%H:%M:%S'`

== How to

You can found a full example using `tcr.sh [folder]`.

It run script `run_test.sh` in specified folder.
You can use `calculator_python` as folder that contain a Python program.

It works on Linux with python, pytest, bash and docker.

== Kata
